欢迎来到这门关于编译器的课程, 我的名字是Alex Aiken, 我是这里的教授
Welcome to this course on compilers. My name is Alex Aiken. I'm a professor here

1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,539
在斯坦福大学, 我们将要讨论的是
at Stanford University. And we're going to be talking about the implementation of

2
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:18,539
编程语言有两种主要的实现方法
programming languages. >> There are two major approaches to implementing

3
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,599
编程语言、编译器和解释器。现在, 这门课主要是
programming languages, compilers, and interpreters. Now, this class is mostly

4
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:30,210
关于编译器, 但是, 我想说几句关于解释器的
about compilers. But, I do want to say a few words about interpreters here in the

5
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,250
第一讲, 解释器会做什么呢, 我要画一个
first lecture. So, what does an interpreter do? Well, I'm gonna draw a

6
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,240
在这里, 这个方框是解释器, 它需要, 我用一个大的标签来标记它
picture here, this box is the interpreter, and it takes, let me label it with a big

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:48,240
我, 它作为输入, 你的程序, 你写的, 不管你的数据是什么
I, it takes as input, your program. That you wrote, And, whatever data that you

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,920
想要运行程序, 它直接产生输出, 意思是
want to run the program on. And it produces the output directly. Meaning that

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,580
它在程序执行之前不会对程序进行任何处理
it doesn't do any processing of the program before it executes it on the

10
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:06,470
输入, 所以你只需要写程序, 然后在数据上调用解释器, 
input, So you just write the program, and you invoke the interpreter on the data,

11
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,380
这个程序马上就开始运行了, 所以, 我们可以说
and the program immediately begins running. And so, we can say that the

12
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:17,740
解释器是在线的, 这意味着它所做的工作都是运行的一部分
interpreter is, is online, meaning it the work that it does is all part of running

13
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:23,950
你的程序, 现在编译器的结构是不同的, 我们可以画一个图
your program. Now a compiler is structured differently. So, we can draw a picture

14
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:30,799
这里, 我们用大写的C来标记, 编译器, 编译器
here. Which we'll label with a big C, for the compiler, And the compiler takes as

15
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,799
输入你的程序, 然后它产生一个可执行文件。
input just your program. And then it produces an executable. And this

16
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,409
可执行文件是另一个程序, 可能是汇编语言, 它可能是字节码。
executable is another program, might be assembly language, it might be bytecode.

17
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:50,069
它可以是任意数量的不同的实现语言, 但是现在可以
It could be in any number of different implementation languages. But now this can

18
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:57,069
在你的数据上分开运行, 这会产生输出, 对吧？
be run separately on your data. And that will produce the output. Okay? And so in

19
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:10,369
这个结构编译器是离线的, 这意味着我们对程序进行预处理
this structure the compiler is offline, Meaning that we pre-process the program

20
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,680
首先, 编译器本质上是一个预处理步骤
first. The compiler is essentially a pre-processing step that produces the

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,319
可执行文件, 然后我们可以在许多不同的输入上运行相同的可执行文件, 
executable, and then we can run that same executable on many, many different inputs,

22
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,540
在许多不同的数据集上不需要重新编译或做任何其他的处理
on many different data sets without having to recompile or do any other processing of

23
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,590
这个项目, 我认为给大家介绍一下这个项目是很有帮助的
the program. I think it's helpful to give a little bit of history about how

24
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,860
编译器和解释器首先被开发, 所以故事开始于
compilers and interpreters were first developed. So the story begins in the

25
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,530
20世纪50年代, 特别是IBM制造的704台机器, 这是
1950s and in particular with a machine called the 704 built by IBM. Thi s was

26
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,030
这是他们的第一个商业上成功的机器, 尽管有一些
their first commercially successful machine, although there had been some

27
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,849
他们尝试过的早期机器, 但不管怎样, 有趣的是
earlier machines that they had tried out. But anyway the interesting thing about the

28
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:54,489
704好吧, 一旦顾客开始购买并使用它, 他们就会发现
704 well, once customers started buying it and using it, is that they found that the

29
00:02:54,489 --> 00:03:00,439
软件成本超过了硬件成本, 而且不仅仅是一点点, 而是
software costs exceeded the hardware costs. And not just by a little bit, but

30
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:06,079
很多时候, 这很重要, 因为这些, 这些天的硬件
by a lot And, This is important because these, the hardware in these, those days

31
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:12,340
是非常昂贵的, 即使是在硬件成本最高的时候
was extremely expensive. And even then when hardware cost the most in absolute

32
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,909
相对的术语, 比它们所花费的要多, 软件已经是
and relative terms, more than they would ever cost again, already the software was

33
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:23,200
占主导地位的花费, 在计算机的使用上, 这导致了
the dominant expense in, in making good use out of computers. And this led a

34
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,599
思考如何更好地编写软件的人的数量。
number of people to think about how they could do a better job of writing software.

35
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:35,599
他们如何使编程更有成效。
How they could make programming more productive. Where the earliest efforts to

36
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:41,189
提高编程的效率称为速度编码, 是在1953年开发的
improve the productivity of programming was called speed coding, developed in 1953

37
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:48,189
John Backus, 现在, 速度编码就是我们今天所说的, 一个早期的例子
by John Backus. Now, speed coding is what we call today, an early example of an

38
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:53,090
和所有的口译员一样, 它也有一些优点和缺点。
interpreter. And like all interpreters, it had some advantages and disadvantages. The

39
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,680
主要的优势是, 开发程序要快得多, 所以, 
primary advantage was that it was much faster, to develop the programs. So the,

40
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,569
从这个意义上说, 程序员的工作效率更高, 但在其中
in that sense, the programmer was much more productive, But among its

41
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:07,310
缺点, 代码编写, 速度代码程序要慢10到20倍。
disadvantages, code written, speed code programs were ten to twenty times slower.

42
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,909
然后是手写的程序这也适用于今天的解释程序, 如果
Then handwritten programs and that's also true of interpreted programs today. So if

43
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:14,890
你有一个使用解释器的实现, 它们将会非常多
you have an implementation that uses an interpreter, they're going to be much

44
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:21,139
比编译器或手工编写代码要慢, 而且速度代码
slower than either a compiler or writing code by hand. And also, the speed code

45
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:26,970
解释器占用了300字节的内存, 这看起来不太像。
interpreter took up, 300 bytes of memory. And that doesn't seem like very much. In

46
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,259
事实上, 300字节, 今天看起来是一个非常小的程序, 但是在那些
fact, 300 bytes, today, would seem like an incredibly tiny, program. But in those

47
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:37,199
天, 你必须记住, 这是30%的记忆
days, you have to keep in mind, that this was 30 Percent Of the memory on the

48
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,080
机器, 这是704的全部记忆的30%
machine. So this was 30 percent of the entire memory of the 704. And so the

49
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,470
解释器占用的空间数量本身就是一个问题, 现在是速度编码
amount of space that the interpreter took up was itself a concern. Now speed coding

50
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,800
没有受到欢迎, 但是John Backus认为这是有希望的并且给了他
did not become popular, but John Backus thought it was promising and it gave him

51
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,150
关于另一个项目的想法, 当时最重要的应用是
the idea for another project. The most important applications in those days were

52
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:01,000
科学计算, 程序员想到的是写下公式
scientific computations, and programmers thought in terms of writing down formulas

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,960
这是机器可以执行的一种形式, 约翰认为速度的问题
in a form that the machine could execute. John thought that the problem with speed

54
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,650
编码是这些公式实际上是被解释的他想, 如果
coding was that the formulas were in fact interpreted and he thought if first the

55
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:18,190
公式被翻译成机器可以直接执行的形式。
formulas were translated in to a form that the machine could execute directly. That

56
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,949
代码会更快, 同时仍然允许程序员编写, 
the code would be faster, And while still allowing the programmer to write the, the,

57
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:30,949
这些程序在高水平上, 因此是公式翻译项目或FORTRAN语言
the programs at a high level, and thus was the Formula Translation Project or FORTRAN

58
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:38,370
从1954年到1957年, FORTRAN从1954年开始运行, 有趣的是, 他们认为
Project born. Now FORTRAN ran from 1954 To 1957, And interestingly, they thought it

59
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,780
只需要一年的时间来编译编译器, 但最终会得到3个编译器。
would only take them one year to build the compiler but it would end up taking three.

60
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,300
就像今天, 他们不太擅长预测软件项目的时间
So just like today, they weren't very good at predicting how long software projects

61
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:56,190
这是一个非常成功的项目, 到1958年, 超过50%
would take. But it was a very successful project. By 1958, over 50 percent of all

62
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:03,190
代码是用FORTRAN编写的, 所以50%的程序都是用FORTRAN编写的, 那就是
code was written in FORTRAN. So 50 percent of programs were in FORTRAN, And, that is

63
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,940
快速采用一种新技术, 我们会很高兴的
very rapid adoption of a new technology. We would be happy with that kind of

64
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,990
今天的成功, 当然在那个时候他们欣喜若狂, 每个人都想
success today, and of course at that time they were ecstatic, And everybody thought

65
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,430
这个FORTRAN既提高了抽象层次, 也提高了程序员的水平
that FORTRAN both raised the level of abstraction, improved programmer

66
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:23,430
生产力, 让每个人都能更好地利用这些机器。
productivity, and allowed everyone to make much better use of these machines. So

67
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:29,490
FORTRAN语言是第一个成功的高级语言它对它产生了巨大的影响
FORTRAN one was the first successful high level language and it had a huge impact on

68
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,770
特别是计算机科学, 它导致了大量的理论工作。
computer science. In particular, it led to an enormous body of theoretical work. And

69
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,419
编程语言的一个有趣之处是
one of the interesting things about programming languages, actually, is the

70
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:43,520
理论和实践的结合因为这是不可能的
combination of theory. And practice because it's not really possible in

71
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,000
编程语言可以很好地完成工作而不需要有一个很好的掌握
programming languages to do a good job without having both a, a very good grasp

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,699
相当深入的理论和良好的工程技能, 所以有很多
of fairly deep theory and also good engineering skills. So there's a lot of

73
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:56,639
非常好的系统在编程语言中构建材料
very good systems building material in programming languages and typically it

74
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,990
涉及到一个非常微妙和富有成果的与理论的互动, 所以, 这个
involves a very subtle and fruitful interaction with theory. And so, and this

75
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,550
我认为, 这是最吸引人的地方是这个地区的主题
is one of the things, I think, that's most attractive about the area's the subject of

76
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,830
学习计算机科学, 而FORTRAN的影响不仅仅是在计算机上
studying computer science. And the impact of FORTRAN was not just on computer

77
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:15,259
当然, 科学研究也在开发, 实用的编译器。
science research, of course, but also on the development of, practical compilers.

78
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:20,699
事实上, 它的影响是如此深远, 以至于今天, 自动编译器仍然
And, in fact, its influence was so profound, that today, auto compilers still

79
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:27,669
保存FORTRAN语言的大纲, 那么FORTRAN语言的结构是什么？
preserve the outlines of FORTRAN one. So what was the structure of FORTRAN one?

80
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:32,470
它包含了五个阶段的词汇分析和解析, 它们一起
Well it consists five phases lexical analysis and parsing, which together take

81
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:38,300
注意语言的句法方面, 语义分析, 
care of the syntactic aspects of the language, semantic analysis, which, of

82
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,300
当然, 要注意更多的语义方面, 比如类型和范围
course, takes care of more semantic aspects, things like types and scope

83
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:50,300
规则, 优化, 它是程序上的一个转换集合
rules. Optimization, Which is a collection of transformations on the program to

84
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,939
要么让它运行得更快, 要么使用更少的内存, 最后是代码生成
either make it run faster or use less memory. And finally code generation which

85
00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:00,970
实际上是翻译到另一代人, 根据我们的目标, 
actually does the translation to another generation. And depending on our goals,

86
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:06,229
这个翻译可能是机器码, 可能是a的咬码
that translation might be to machine codes. It might be to a bite code for a

87
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:12,069
虚拟机。它可能是另一种高级编程语言。
virtual machine. It might be to another high level programming language. Well

88
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:16,139
这就是这节课的内容, 下节课我们会讲到这些
that's it for this lecture, and next time we'll pick up here and talk about these

89
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,999
更详细的五个阶段。
five phases in more detail.
